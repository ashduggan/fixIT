          <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
          <p>We would like to design and create a mobile phone application that helps users with IT problems. The application would use a “twenty questions” based system that would allow the user to narrow down their problem based on diagnosis questions asked by the application. <p>
          The application would have use AVL tree’s to store the questions and answers to the IT problems. Problems and solutions would be able to be added by users. The tree would be able to balance itself so that the root question is always an equivalent distance to each  solution.<p>
          The idea is that this would be a crowd based system that would allow users to answer questions and thus entering more nodes into the tree allowing it to grow. Our application of this system is for IT questions, since that is what we have experience in, but this sort of system could be applied to any situation that needs diagnosing, for example, automotive diagnosis, plant or animal identification, or illness diagnosis.
